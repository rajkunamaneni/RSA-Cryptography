# Public Key Cryptography

Public Key Cryptography Encryption and Decryption. The private and public keys are generated with the file Keygen. With the keys created, we can encrypt and decrypt files.

## Build

Program build, run `make`.

Build a single program with:
 - '''
`make keygen`
'''
 - '''
`make encrypt`
'''
 - '''
`make decrypt`
'''

## Run

Run the program by creating the Public and Private keys via Keygen. View ./keygen -h to understand program functionality. Following keygen, run ./encrypt to encrypt any text provided and ./decrypt to decrypt the following encrypted file via the private key.

## Issues

The program currently has no documented issues.
